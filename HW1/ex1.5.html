            The Department of Biology covers the spectrum of biological organization from the molecular world to the
            ecosystems all around us. The department offers degrees in Biology (undergraduate degree in biology and
            graduate degree in biology), Molecular Biology (undergraduate degree in molecular biology and graduate
            degree in molecular biology) and Biology with a concentration in Environmental Science or in Education for
            undergraduates and a concentration in Ecology and Evolution, Physiology, or Pedagogy for graduates. The
            campus community have access to condensed course options that fulfill general education requirements.
            Beyond the Department offerings, we maintain significant roles in the interdisciplinary BS in Science
            Informatics, BS/MS in Marine Biology and Coastal Sciences and PhD in Environmental Management. Externally,
            we participate with other institutions in articulated medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy,
            physician assistant, nursing, and optometry.

            The Department of Mathematical Sciences consists of faculty grouped into three broad areas: pure and
            applied mathematics, math education, and statistics. Our department offers bachelor’s degrees in
            Mathematics with different areas of specialization. Master’s Degrees in Mathematics, Mathematics Education,
            and Statistics are also offered. There are even combined BS/MS programs to get both a bachelor’s and
            master’s degrees in less time. For educators looking for a competitive advantage teaching mathematics, we
            offer a PhD in Mathematics Education.

            Students find that almost any scientific problem can be approached using physics, and as a result there are
            many hybrid disciplines such as astrophysics, biophysics and geophysics. Physics’ application to other
            sciences means that it is an ideal starting point for entry into almost every branch of science,
            engineering and technology.
